# Username-Generator

This is a simple Username Generator that is meant to help you sign up for services when you're just not feeling creative enough to come up with your own username. To get your randomly generated username just press the blue button that says "click to generate a Username". Then boom!! There you have it. If it so happens that the username that you were given is already in use then feel free to spam the button until you get a username that works for you! Just dont forget what you used. 

Building this webpage was fun and simple. I will come back to this once I get better at JavaScript and I can change a few things that I think you make this website an actual services. But for now please enjoy and use this to your hearts desire!
